3**D Shortest Path Search and Visualization:**
**1. Introduction**
-> This project focuses on finding the shortest path in a 3D grid using Dijkstra’s algorithm.
**The project involves:**
Constructing a 3D Grid Graph using NetworkX
Assigning random weights to nodes
Finding the shortest path between selected points
Visualizing the paths in 3D
2. Algorithms Used
2.1 Grid Graph Construction
We use NetworkX to generate a 3D grid graph, where:
Each node is represented as (x, y, z).
Nodes are connected to their six neighbors (left, right, front, back, up, and down).
**2.2 Dijkstra’s Algorithm
Dijkstra’s algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes based on their weights.
Steps of Dijkstra’s Algorithm:**
Initialize: Set all node distances to ∞, except the start node (0).
Select Node: Choose the node with the smallest distance.
Update Neighbors: Check if moving to a neighbor reduces its distance; if yes, update it.
Repeat: Continue until reaching the target node.
**3. Implementation Details**
**3.1 Importing Libraries
python:**
import numpy as np
import networkx as nx
import random
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D
networkx → Creates and processes the 3D graph.
random → Assigns random weights.
matplotlib.pyplot → Visualizes paths in 3D.
**3.2 Creating a 3D Grid Graph
python:**
GRID_SIZE = 20  # Define the grid size
# Create a 3D grid graph
G = nx.grid_graph(dim=[GRID_SIZE+1, GRID_SIZE+1, GRID_SIZE+1])
print("Graph created with", len(G.nodes), "nodes.")
Creates a 3D cube grid with (GRID_SIZE+1)^3 nodes.
Each node connects to its six neighboring nodes.
**3.3 Assigning Random Weights
python:**
for node in G.nodes:
    G.nodes[node]['weight'] = random.choice([1, 1, 1, 5, 10, 15])
print("Weights assigned.")
Weights simulate terrain difficulty (low values = easy to cross, high values = hard).
**3.4 Finding the Shortest Path Using Dijkstra**
**python:**
def shortest_path(graph, start, end):
    print(f"Finding shortest path from {start} to {end}...")
    return nx.shortest_path(graph, source=start, target=end, weight='weight', method='dijkstra')
Uses NetworkX’s Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the best path.
**3.5 Finding Paths Between Selected Points**
**python:**
start_end_pairs = [
    ((0, 0, 0), (10, 10, 10)),  
    ((5, 5, 5), (15, 15, 15))
]
paths = []
for start, end in start_end_pairs:
    try:
        path = shortest_path(G, start, end)
        paths.append(path)
        print(f"Path found: {len(path)} steps.")
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error finding path:", e)
Computes shortest paths for selected pairs of points.
3.6 3D Path Visualization
**python:**
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')
# Plot each path
for path in paths:
    x, y, z = zip(*path)
    ax.plot(x, y, z, marker='o')
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')
ax.set_zlabel('Z')
plt.title("3D Shortest Paths")
plt.show()
Plots paths in 3D using Matplotlib.
